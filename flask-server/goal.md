Objective: Owing to the fluctuating prices of cryptocurrency and shares, e-trading has been a major concern for investors. It has been a trending topic among the biggest economists like Elon Musk, Raghu Ram Ranjan, and others. If you can create a bot using web scraping that can help you predict the prices of cryptocurrencies or stocks, it can be of great benefit.

Project Idea: In this project, you would need a website that serves you with all the relevant information on stocks, shares, or cryptocurrency. One such helpful website, for instance, is CoinMarketCap, which hosts all the related information on cryptocurrencies such as NFTs, their trend record over the last seven days, and so on.

For implementing this web scraping project, you can use Pythonâ€™s BeautifulSoup.
